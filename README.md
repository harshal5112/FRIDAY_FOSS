# 🤖 Friday: AI-Powered Coding Assistant

## 📝 Project Description

**Friday** is an AI-powered voice assistant tailored specifically for coders. It assists with coding-related challenges such as:

- 🔍 Finding syntax for basic pages or applications.
- 📂 Providing guidance on folder structure for projects.
- 📋 Allowing users to copy code snippets from lectures for easy implementation.
- ⚡ Automating coding tasks to enhance productivity.

## 🌟 Overview

Friday leverages **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech synthesis**, and **automation libraries** to offer an interactive and hands-free coding assistant. It aims to streamline development by minimizing repetitive tasks and providing quick access to essential coding resources.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎙️ Voice Interaction
- 🗣️ Uses `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech output.
- 🎧 Uses `speech_recognition` for processing user commands.

### 💻 Coding Assistance
- 📜 Provides syntax for commonly used programming constructs.
- 📂 Suggests folder structures for different projects (Web, App, Machine Learning, etc.).
- 📋 Enables copying code from lectures for direct implementation.

### 🖥️ System Operations
- ⏰ Provides greetings based on the time of day.
- 🛑 Controls system functionalities such as:
  - 🔄 Shutdown, Restart, Lock, Hibernate the system.
  - 📝 Open/Close coding applications like VS Code, Terminal, and Notepad++.
  - 🔊 Adjust volume (Increase, Decrease).
  - 🗒️ Take notes in Notepad and Sticky Notes.

### 🌐 Web Automation for Coding Resources
- 🔍 Searches for code snippets and syntax references on **Stack Overflow** and documentation sites.
- 📄 Summarizes search results using `BeautifulSoup`.
- 🌍 Opens and controls browser tabs for coding resources.

### 🎥 Media Control
- ▶️ Plays coding tutorial videos from **YouTube**.
- 📂 Opens saved local tutorials.
- 📸 Takes screenshots and saves them with a user-defined name.

### 🤖 Automation & Navigation
- 🖱️ Uses `pyautogui` for:
  - 🔄 Navigating between applications.
  - ⌨️ Automating typing for repetitive code.
  - 🏄 Handling browser tabs (Open, Close, Switch).
- 🌍 Retrieves system’s IP address using `requests`.

### 🌍 Chrome Automation
- 📂 Opens Chrome and automates searches for coding-related topics.
- 🏗️ Creates and manages multiple tabs and windows.
