## Libraries Used

- `time` - For managing timing and delays.

## How It Works

### 1. Voice Commands
Friday uses the `speech_recognition` library to listen to voice inputs via the microphone. After recognizing the speech, it converts the command to text and executes the relevant task.

### 2. Task Automation
Friday can automate tasks like opening applications, performing web searches, and controlling system settings, using Python libraries like `os`, `webbrowser`, `pyautogui`, and others.

### 3. Speech Output
Friday responds with spoken feedback using `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech conversion, informing the user of the status of their request.
